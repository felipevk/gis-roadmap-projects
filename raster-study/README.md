# Week 3 - Raster Data

Practiced using QGIS to work with Raster Data. 

The goal is to categorize each zone by its average elevation.

## What I Did
- Downloaded digital elevation model (https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/digital-elevation-model/information/)
- Loaded zone boundary data
- Used Zonal Statistics to calculate the average, min and max height of each zone in the polygon layer
- Displayed average height using graded symbology
