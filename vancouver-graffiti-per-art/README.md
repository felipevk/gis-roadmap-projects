# PostGIS Study

Practiced using Spatial SQL with PostGIS for data storage and spatial querying

## What I Did
- Downloaded graffiti and public art datasets from (https://opendata.vancouver.ca/)
- Installed Postgres and PostGIS
- Created a database and loaded datasets into it
- Performed queries to find the ratio between number of public art pieces and graffiti based on city zones
- Used spatial indexing to improve queries
