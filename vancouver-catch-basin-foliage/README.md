# Week 1 â€“ QGIS Basics

Practiced core GIS concepts using QGIS. 

The goal is to identify catch basins with high nearby tree density as potential sites for higher maintenance needs due to clogging.

## What I Did
- Installed QGIS and explored the interface
- Loaded zoning and parks shapefiles from the [City Of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/)
- Exported a basic zoning map with legend and labels for registered trees and catch basins
- Filtered local data by West End neighborhood using filters
- Used operations to find the nearest trees to each catch basin
- Generated a print layout with Tree influence over catch basins in West End
